<div id="content">

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We have covered a plethora of security topics in this class.  For the final project in the class, you will delve into a current security issue of your choice.  This is not only your opportunity to specialize on a topic, but also to stand out and gain hands-on experience in the field.</p>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>My hope of this final project is that you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specialize in a current security issue of your choice</li>
<li>Gain hands-on experience in the field</li>
<li>Demonstrate technical knowledge</li>
<li>Communicate clearly to a community</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>For this final project, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a mentor</li>
<li>Write a paper</li>
<li>Provide your own supporting material that complements your paper</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Mentor</h2>
<p>The mentor can either me or someone in the industry.  The mentor cannot be a student in the class.  Should you choose someone other than me as your mentor, please send me the person's name, title, and e-mail address.</p>

<h2>The Paper</h2>
<p>The following are the guidelines for the paper:</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li>Required sections of paper:
<ul>
<li><span class="stress">Abstract</span></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Supporting Material</h2>
<p>Along with your paper, you must produce a supporting material for your paper.  Options:</p>
<ol>
