<h1>Introduction to Computer Security</h1>
<h2>COMP 116, Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Fall 2013</h2>
<h2>Assignment 1: Packet Sleuth</h2>
<h2>Due: Tuesday, September 17th at 11:59 PM</h2>
</div>

<div id="content">
	<h2>Objectives</h2>
	<p>In this assignment, you will learn how to <span class="stress">read</span> and <span class="stress">dissect</span> files and sensitive information (including usernames and passwords) from sets of packets captured from a network using freely available tools.</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>You are given two sets of packet captures from two different networks in PCAP format to analyze: one from a network where file transfers occurred, and the other from arguably the world's most hostile network, DEF CON in Las Vegas, NV (from Friday, August 2, 2013).</p>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>Download the following PCAP files:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Set 1: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/downloads/a1/set1.pcap" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/downloads/a1/set1.pcap</a> (124 KB)</li>
		<li>Set 2: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/downloads/a1/set2.pcap" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/downloads/a1/set2.pcap</a> (64 MB)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Open and analyze both sets of data, one at a time, using <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> and <code>tshark</code> (command line-based that is installed with Wireshark).  You free to use additional open source tools including <a href="http://ettercap.github.io/ettercap/" target="_blank">Ettercap</a>, <a href="http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">ngrep</a>, to name a few.  In a <code>README.txt</code> (text format) or <code>README.md</code> (Markdown format), please answer all the questions below.  <span class="note">NOTE: I will NOT accept your work if your answers to the questions are in another file format!</span></p>

	<h3><code>set1.pcap</code></h3>
	<p>1. How many packets are there in this set?</p>
	<p>2. What protocol was used to transfer files from PC to server?</p>
	<p>3. Briefly describe why the protocol used to transfer the files is insecure?</p>
	<p>4. What is the secure alternative to the protocol used to transfer files?</p>
	<p>5. What is the IP address of the server?</p>
	<p>6. What was the username and password used to access the server?</p>
	<p>7. How many files were transferred from PC to server?</p>
	<p>8. What are the names of the files transferred from PC to server?</p>
	<p>9. Extract all the files that were transferred from PC to server.  <span class="note">These files must be part of your submission!</span></p>
	<h3><code>set2.pcap</code></h3>
	<p>10. How many packets are there in your set?</p>
	<p>11. How many plaintext username-password pairs are there in this packet set?</p>
	<p>12. Briefly describe how you found the username-password pairs.</p>
	<p>13. For each of the plaintext username-password pair that you found, identify the protocol used, server IP, the corresponding domain name (e.g., <code>google.com</code>), and port number.</p>
	<p class="note">IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT LOG ON TO THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USERNAME-PASSWORD THAT YOU FOUND!</p>
	<p>14. Of all the plaintext username-password pairs that you found, how many of them are legitimate?  That is, the username-password was valid, access successfully granted?</p>
	<p>15. How did you verified the successful username-password pairs?</p>
	<p>16. In a few words, explain why I asked you not to log on to websites or services associated with the username-password pairs that you found.</p>
	<p>17. What advice would you give to the owners of the username-password pairs that you found so their account information would not be revealed "in-the-clear" in the future?</p>
	<p>18. Provide a listing of all IP addresses with corresponding hosts (hostname + domain name) that are in this PCAP set. Describe your methodology.</p>
	<p>19. Provide a summary of the all protocols used.  What was the most popular protocol used?  Describe your methodology.</p>
	<p>20. A fun question: what other interesting things did you find in this PCAP set (e.g., files)?</p>
	<h2>Submission</h2>
	<p>Push all the files (e.g., README and files extracted from <code>set1.pcap</code>) to the private repository that I created for you in a folder named <code>pcaps</code>.  Say that your private repository is named <code>mchow-comp116</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>mchow-comp116/pcaps</code>.</p>
