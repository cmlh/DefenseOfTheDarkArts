<div id="content">
	<h3 class="note">You do not need to submit this lab.</h3>
	<p>Because this is largely a hands-on course, it is essential that you learn many of the fundamental Unix / Linux commands, an important skill for any good security practitioner.  Please learn and tinker with the following commands and answer the questions below.  <span class="note">Please note: many will require flags!</span></p>
	<p><code>ls, rm, mkdir, rmdir, cd, pwd, ln, chmod, umask, ping, cut, sort, which, grep, whereis, finger, w, who, whoami, last, file, strings, top, ps, nice, nohup, kill, signal, more, less, ifconfig, arp, nslookup, cat, uname, history, netstat, ifconfig, traceroute, dig, man, lsof, crontab, nc, uniq, id, groups, df, du</code></p>
	<ul>
	<li>How would you find the path to the <code>perl</code> command?</li>
	<li>What command can you use to find out your IP address and MAC address?</li>
	<li>What command can you use to show all the processes that are running on the system?</li>
	<li>What command can you use to get more details about running processes listening on ports?</li>
	<li>What one command could you use to list every file, <span class="stress">including hidden files</span>, on the entire system, showing their owner, location, and access time?</li>
	<li>Assume you found a file named <code>/tmp/tini</code>.  What command could you use to find out what type of file this was?</li>
	<li>So you discovered that <code>/tmp/tini</code> is a binary executable.  What command could you use to extract any readable information from the file without running it?  Also, try this on a compressed file such a ZIP or JAR</li>
	<li>What command can you use to see the most active processes on a system?</li>
	<li>What command can you use to find the IP address-to-MAC address mappings for systems on the local
	 network?</li>
	<li>What command can you use to find the IP addresses of other machines? (few acceptable answers)</li>
	</ul>
